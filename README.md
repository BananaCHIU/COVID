# COVID HK

## Inspiration
Lots of Hong Kong people went crazy in finding masks, hand sanitizers, and other medical supplies. And they feel worried about the availability of different supplies. Therefore, we would like to build a platform for medical supplies availability. 

## What it does
1. Figures on the confirmed, recovered and death cases in Hong Kong
2. A platform for the local Hongkongers to report medical supply availability
3. Local COVID-19 virus news by the Hong Kong Government
4. Map of the locations where the confirmed case patients had traveled to.
5. Users have to verify and log in using email to prevent spamming in our app

## How I built it
Using Android Studio to make the app
Firebase for the backend servers
GitHub for version control

## Challenges I ran into
The time is restricted, so we have to build the app in a hurry. Therefore, real user feedback and improvements can't be made. We also implemented new technologies that we never used, like the real-time database interaction between the mobile device and our server.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The app is finally working and prepared for real implementation. The most important function is the platform to report medical supplies. We hope that users can report meaningful data, and this is helpful for all of us.

## What I learned
We learned to make an application that works in real-time. We have a server behind to process all the data provided by the user. Therefore, it so fruitful for us to learn all the skills of communication between the android phone and the server, and also the skills to process the meaningful data.

## What's next for COVID HK
Provide a function for the user to report false or outdated information.
An online forum for discussion of the local COVID-19 virus situation
Build a Chinese version
Support more countries
